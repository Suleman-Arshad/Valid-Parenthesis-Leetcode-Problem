Bracket Validator
This project provides a C++ implementation of a bracket validator function that checks whether a given string containing only brackets is valid.

âœ… Problem Statement
Given a string s containing just the characters:

'(', ')'

'{', '}'

'[', ']'

Determine if the input string is valid.

A string is valid if:
Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.

Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

Every closing bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

ðŸ“˜ Example
Input	Output
"()"	true
"()[]{}"	true
"(]"	false
"([)]"	false
"{[]}"	true

ðŸ’¡ Approach
The solution uses a stack data structure to:

Push every opening bracket onto the stack.

When a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack.

If it does, pop the stack.

If not, or if the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, return false.

After processing the entire string, the stack should be empty for the input to be valid.
ðŸ§ª How to Run
Copy the above code into a .cpp file (e.g., BracketValidator.cpp).

Compile it using a C++ compiler:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -std=c++11 BracketValidator.cpp -o validator
Run it with your own test cases by calling the isValid function from a main() function.
